Teaching makes a difference. I enjoy teaching because I can motivate, encourage, and inspire students. As an instructor, I embrace the following three principles in teaching: (1) student-centered and equitable teaching; (2) intentional active learning; (3) growth mindset. When teaching econometrics courses, I always make every effort to explain the abstract concepts and complex methods in a simple and intuitive way. I have maintained a 100% approval rating from students for all the econometrics courses I taught since 2020.

Please see the following records for more details.

  > Haitian was by far the most empathetic with students and understood the issues we found the most challenging. His reviews were very useful and to the point. Overall, it was a very nice experience having him as a TA.

  > Haitian is very prepared and professional. You can clearly see that he has a lot of experience on the subject and the course. The discussions were fundamental to integrate the material covered in class and Haitian was able to organize the sessions in a very clever and clear way. It surprised me how good he is at explaining complex topics in simple words.
