Welcome to my website! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Economics Department](https://economics.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, co-advised by Professor [Graham Elliott](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gelliott/) and Professor [Yixiao Sun](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~yisun/). Before joining UCSD, I received my BA in Economics and BS in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn).

My research fields are econometrics and economic theory. My recent research focuses on
- Causal inference
  - regression discontinuity design
  - local average treatment effect
- Personalized policy design
- Robust mechanism design
- Data-based price discrimination
