Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD candidate (dissertation defended, graduating in June) in the [Economics Department](https://economics.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, co-advised by Professor [Graham Elliott](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gelliott/) and Professor [Yixiao Sun](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~yisun/). Before joining UCSD, I received my BA in Economics and BS in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn). 

After graduation, I will join Peking University, Guanghua School of Management as an Assistant Professor.

My research focuses on econometrics, causal inference, statistical decisions.
