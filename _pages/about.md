Welcome to my website! 

I am an Assistant Professor at Peking University, Guanghua School of Management, Department of Business Statistics and Econometrics.

My research focuses on econometrics, causal inference, statistical decisions.

I obtained my PhD from the [Economics Department](https://economics.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, where I had the privilege of being co-advised by Professor [Graham Elliott](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gelliott/) and Professor [Yixiao Sun](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~yisun/). Prior to that, I received my BA in Economics and BS in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn).
